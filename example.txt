Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability of computer systems to perform tasks that 
typically need human intelligence, like learning, reasoning, problem-solving, understanding language,
and recognizing patterns, by analyzing data to make decisions and predictions, 
enabling automation and smart applications from virtual assistants to self-driving cars. 
It's a branch of computer science that creates algorithms to simulate these cognitive functions,
allowing machines to adapt and improve over time without explicit programming for every scenario.
